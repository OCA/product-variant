====================================
Invoice Product Variant Configurator
====================================

Product variant configurator on invoice lines.

Installation
============

There is no specific installation instructions for this module.

Configuration
=============

The module is usable without configuration. On invoice forms, when adding
or modifying lines, the user can specify attribute values so the system
will select the correct product automatically, or propose to create a
new product variant if no corresponding variant exists.

With this module, it is best to set the "Variant creations" option
on product templates to "Don't create them automatically".
