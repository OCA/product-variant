==========================
Product Variant Sale Price
==========================

This module allows to handle sale price at product variant level
(product.product) instead at product level (product.template), which is the
default. It's achieved by adding to the product the field 'Variant Sale Price'.

This module also provides a pricelist based on the latter.
